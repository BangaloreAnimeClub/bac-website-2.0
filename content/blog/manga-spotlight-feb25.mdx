_GTO: The Early Years_ or _Shonan Junai Gumi!_, written by Fujisawa Tohru, is an action-comedy manga with a school setting. The story follows the Oni-Baku duo (one of them will eventually become the greatest teacher in Japan) and their shenanigans as they pursue their ultimate goal: getting laid. Though the story mostly focuses on their inability to achieve this throughout the manga due to various reasons, it also follows their rivalry with various gangs, their school friendships, and the fame they will carry into the sequel, GTO.

As it is an older manga, its art has a nostalgic feel, but it is still good enough to be enjoyable today. Subjectively, if you want to read something that will make you laugh, has consistently good chapters, and features iconic characters who will stick with you for a long time, this and GTO might be just the thing for you.
