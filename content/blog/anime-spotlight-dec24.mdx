This weekâ€™s anime recommendation is **_Given_**, a high-school music/drama series directed by Yamaguchi Hikaru, and produced by Studio Lerche.

The story follows the lives of 4 members of the band _Given_, and at the heart of the story is Satou Mafuyu, a guitarist who is recruited into the band by his schoolmate Uenoyama Ritsuka, another fellow guitarist. 
What follows is a bittersweet, healing story of love, forgiveness, and music. 
Mafuyu's story and growth invokes a melancholic feeling in the beginning, and blossoms into a heartwarming tale.
It makes one cry, laugh, and get angry and fall in love with Mafuyu and Ritsuka, watching them grow as people. 
The music by band Centimilimental blends seamlessly into the story culminating in an explosive song that serves as the theme for Season 1.
The story has been adapted from the manga and currently has 1 season, 1 OVA and 3 movies.
