_The Summit of the Gods_ is a masterful manga adaptation of Baku Yumemakura's novel, illustrated by Jiro Taniguchi. This five-volume series blends the thrill of mountaineering with a profound exploration of human ambition and obsession. The story follows Fukamachi Makoto, a photojournalist, who becomes entangled in a mystery involving George Mallory's lost camera, potentially holding answers to whether Mallory was the first to summit Everest. This leads Fukamachi to Habu J√¥ji, an enigmatic climber, whose personal journey is equally captivating and tragic.

Taniguchi's artwork is breathtaking, capturing the grandeur of the Himalayas as well as the glimpses of lifestyle in the valleys of it with meticulous detail. The characters are deeply fleshed out, their motivations and inner struggles are masterfully captured. Themes of pursuing the meaning, power of human spirit against nature's adversity, and the allure of unattainable make it resonate beyond its mountaineering focus.

It's a gripping read for the fans of adventure, drama, and philosophical storytelling, offering both edge-of-your-seat moments and profound introspection. If you're a fan of works like _The Climber (Kokou no Hito)_ this manga is for you.

P.S. The manga was adapted into a

and a

_Toilet-bound Hanako-kun_ is an absolutely enchanting manga that will pull you into a world of
mystery, magic, and heartwarming moments. The story follows Nene Yashiro, a high school student
who is determined to find love no matter what. Her curiosity leads her to the "Seven Wonders" of
her school, where she summons the infamous Hanako-kun, a supernatural being said to grant
wishes. But when Nene meets him, she discovers that Hanako-kun is nothing like the scary legend
she expected. He's playful, mischievous, and a bit of a troublemaker who has a hidden kindness that
makes him irresistible.
