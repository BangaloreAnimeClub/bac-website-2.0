</div>

_**Genres:** Isekai, Fantasy, Comedy, Shounen Ai_ \
_**Studios:** Deen_ 

_Kyo Kara Maou!_ Is a wild, hilarious, and surprisingly heartfelt ride! The story kicks off when Yuuri, an average high school boy, gets flushed down a toilet (yes, really) and ends up in another world where he’s suddenly declared the Demon King. Talk about a weird promotion! Things get even crazier when he accidentally gets engaged to Wolfram, a cute 82 y.o. demon prince who looks like a teenager (demon aging is weird, okay?).

</div>

This anime blends fantasy, comedy, and shounen ai in the best way expect political intrigue, magical battles, and plenty of awkward romantic tension. There are no game-like stats or overpowered cheat skills; Yuuri’s strength comes from his kindness (and occasionally his temper). The characters are all lovable, especially the fiery Wolfram and the ever-suffering Gunther.

If you enjoy isekai with a twist, chaotic relationships, and a mix of humor and drama, Kyo Kara Maou! Is a must-watch.

  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#2</span> The Story of Saiunkoku**
</div>

_**Genres:** Adventure, Fantasy, Romance, Reverse Harem_ \
_**Studios:** Madhouse_ 

If y’all liked _The Apothecary Diaries_, then _The Story of Saiunkoku_ (aka Color Cloud Palace) is the anime/manga for you! This Chinese period fantasy delivers everything you could want an exceptionally strong female lead, political intrigue, and a dreamy reverse harem with just the right amount of romance for josei and Shoujo fans.

<div style={{marginBottom: '0px', marginTop: '0px', textAlign: 'center'}}>

</div>

What really makes this show special is its badass (in her own unique way) female lead, Shuurei. She’s not your typical sword-swinging heroine—her strength lies in her intelligence, determination, and unwavering moral compass. Watching her grow as she chases her dream of entering politics (in a world dominated by men!) is beyond satisfying. Plus, the storytelling is top-tier, weaving in deep philosophical and moral questions while keeping you hooked on her journey.  

And yes, there’s romance, but what I love most is how Shuurei prioritizes her goals and helping others over love. It’s refreshing to see a heroine so dedicated to her ambitions. If you’re into smart, character-driven stories with heart, politics, and a touch of romance, Color Cloud Palace is an absolute gem!

  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#3</span> Black Cat**
</div>

_**Genres:** Action, Adventure, Sci-fi_ \
_**Studios:** Gonzo_ 

If you love _Sakamoto Days_ and its mix of slick action, comedy, and badass ex-assassins, then _Black Cat_ is 100% your next binge! This 2006 gem follows Train Heartnet, a former elite assassin (sound familiar?) who ditches his cold-blooded life to become a carefree bounty hunter. The vibe is similar to Sakamoto’s shift from legendary hitman to goofy convenience store dad except Train keeps his edge while gaining a heart.

  <img src="/images/blog/anime-which-people-dont-talk-about/03.webp" className="rounded-xl" style={{margin: '0 auto', display: 'block'}} />
</div>

The fights are chef’s kiss smooth, fast, and packed with style, just like Sakamoto’s ridiculous takedowns. And the chemistry between Train and his found-family crew (especially Sven, the goofy-but-brilliant sweeper) gives off major Taro & Shin vibes. Plus, the villains? Wild, over-the-top, and sometimes hilarious, just like Sakamoto Days bizarre assassins.  

The anime does rush the ending a bit (manga readers know), but the journey is so worth it. If you’re craving more of that perfect blend of action, humor, and redemption arcs, _Black Cat_ is your fix.

  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#4</span> Lovely Complex**
</div>

_**Genres:** Comedy, Romance, Shoujo_ \
_**Studios:** Toei Animation_ 

_Lovely Complex_ is an absolute delight! This anime nails the perfect blend of laugh-out-loud comedy and adorable romance, making it one of my all-time favorite shoujo series. The height difference between Risa and Otani alone is comedy gold their constant bickering and ridiculous antics had me in stitches. But what really gets me is how their relationship slowly evolves from frenemies to something so sweet and genuine.

<div style={{marginBottom: '0px', marginTop: '0px', textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/blog/anime-which-people-dont-talk-about/04.webp" className="rounded-xl" style={{margin: '0 auto', display: 'block'}} />
</div>

And can we talk about that confession scene at the stadium?! My heart was racing! After all the misunderstandings and near-misses, seeing Otani finally pour his heart out awkwardly, passionately, perfectly was everything. The way Risa just runs to him, crying and laughing, is such a satisfying payoff. It’s one of those anime moments that just sticks with you forever.  

The humor is top-tier, the romance is fluffy yet realistic, and the chemistry between the leads is unbeatable. _Lovely Complex_ is a must-watch for anyone who loves rom-coms with big emotions and even bigger laughs!

  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#5</span> Desert Punk**
</div>

_**Genres:** Action, Adventure, Sci-fi, Ecchi_ \
_**Studios:** Gonzo_ 

If you’re looking for an anime that doesn’t hold back on the laughs, the fan service, or the sheer insanity of its main character, _Desert Punk_ is your show. This post-apocalyptic comedy is packed with over-the-top action, ridiculous humor, and an MC who’s equal parts badass and total degenerate.  

Sunaboz (aka Desert Punk) is one of the most entertaining anti-heroes ever a skilled mercenary with a legendary reputation … and a serious weakness for women. His perverted antics are next-level, whether he’s sneaking peeks, making absurdly lewd comments, or getting himself into trouble because of his hormones. The ecchi elements are everywhere, but they’re played for laughs so well that even when you facepalm, you can’t stop grinning.

<div style={{marginBottom: '0px', marginTop: '0px', textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/blog/anime-which-people-dont-talk-about/05.webp" className="rounded-xl" style={{margin: '0 auto', display: 'block'}} />
</div>

The comedy is gold. crude, unapologetic, and perfectly timed. From slapstick mishaps to Desert Punk’s shameless scheming, every episode delivers something ridiculous. And don’t even get me started on the dynamic between him and the women in the series, especially the cunning, no-nonsense Kosuna, who constantly outsmarts him in the most satisfying ways.  

If you love ecchi done with a sense of humor and a protagonist who’s more horny than heroic, _Desert Punk_ is a must-watch. Just don’t expect any dignity this show thrives on chaos, and that’s exactly why it’s so damn fun.
