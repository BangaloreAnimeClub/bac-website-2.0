### **The Heart of Valentine's Day**

## **The Heart of Valentine's Day**
</div>

Valentine's Day has always held a special place in my heart. It’s that one day of the year when love fills the air, and everyone, from couples to single folks, gets to bask in a little extra warmth. As an admin of BAC, I, **Editor-chan**, wanted to create something that allowed everyone to get involved. Something that celebrates love in all its forms. Initially, I envisioned a simple story-building event, but little did I know, **Editor-san (aka Sakaido)**, would have a different, brilliant idea...

### **Story Concept - A Simple Idea, Big Dream**
</div>

## **Story Concept - A Simple Idea, Big Dream**
</div>

At first, the concept was simple: let’s build a fun, interactive story. The idea was that everyone could contribute, whether it was a line of dialogue, a choice, or a twist in the plot. I wanted to create something where every participant’s voice could be heard and celebrated. And thus, the foundations of what became BAC Love Story were born. But as much as I loved this idea, it still had a major flaw. What if we ended up with so many entries that we couldn’t keep track of everything? I thought it better to keep it as a limited event. I knew that this event needed to be something that felt welcoming to everyone, regardless of how big or small their contributions were.

That’s when Editor-san came in with his genius suggestion: **A choice-based game.** The beauty of this format is that it allows for an almost endless number of participants, with each choice helping shape the narrative. This way, people could jump in and make their mark, and the story would grow in unexpected ways.

### **Characters - The Heartbeat of the Story**

## **Characters - The Heartbeat of the Story**
</div>

Of course, a love story needs characters, and I knew we had to create ones that everyone could connect with. Each character would be crafted from the many contributions of participants, each representing a piece of a larger puzzle.

The first of our trio is **Jun**, the shy and nervous boy whose heart is full of hidden desires but struggles to express them. Jun embodies the quiet, introverted type who may seem passive at first glance, but his journey is about overcoming his fears, learning to speak from the heart, and confronting his self-doubt.

**Hana**, on the other hand, is a stubborn tsundere—outwardly cold and quick to defend herself, but with a heart that is just as fragile as it is fierce. Beneath the brash exterior is a girl who is deeply passionate but finds it hard to show vulnerability. Hana's complexities come from her push-and-pull dynamic with Jun: she wants to confess, but her pride and fear of rejection often get in the way. Throughout the game, Hana’s relationship with Jun evolves, driven by the player’s choices. Will they soften her heart, or will Hana’s stubbornness keep her at arm's length?

Then there’s **Reina**, the rival. She isn’t just a simple antagonist; she’s someone who challenges Hana and, in doing so, creates tension and intrigue. Reina is competitive, assertive, and at times even a little sly. Her feelings for Hana are far more complex than they appear on the surface. Though she often comes across as confident and even a little mischievous, she’s constantly thinking about Hana, what she wants, and how she fits into Hana’s world. Reina sees herself as a contender for Jun's heart, but it's her connection to Hana that makes things more complicated. The rivalry isn’t just about Jun; it’s about two people vying for the same affection, each unaware of how much they might need each other.

The beauty of BAC Love Story is that, just like in real life, these characters are ever-evolving, and no one’s journey is ever truly set in stone. The more the player invests in understanding them, the more they realize that the story is just as much about the personal growth of each individual as it is about love itself.

### **Paths the Story Could Follow - A Heart with Many Roads**
</div>

</div>

As we started building the structure of the game, it became clear that the story could follow countless paths, thanks to the choice-based structure. I was thrilled by the possibilities—but also a little overwhelmed. Every choice would have ripple effects,leading to different scenarios, different interactions, and, ultimately, different endings. What made the creation process even more exciting was the fact that every choice in the game was contributed by a participant from BAC. Each contribution brought its own flavor and perspective, making the story feel alive and ever-changing. Some participants’ entries gave more subtle dialogue options that added depth to the characters, while others proposed bold twists that could shift the entire narrative. It was like a collaborative puzzle, with each piece fitting perfectly to shape the journey ahead.

</div>

The real challenge came in ensuring that all these branching paths and divergent endings still fit within a cohesive story. Would Hana’s stubbornness clash with Jun’s quiet nature,or would it lead to moments of growth? Would Reina’s rivalry help her realize her true feelings, or would it keep her locked in a battle of wills? Every twist and turn felt like a delicate balance, but it was this very collaboration that created a rich, engaging experience for the players.

## **The Creative Team Behind the Game**
</div>

This project wouldn’t have come to life without the incredible team behind the scenes. When it came time to design the game, I enlisted the help of some truly talented people.

First off, there’s **Aravind**, our web wizard. My partner in crime for this entire event. Without Ara-chan, the entire game wouldn’t have been possible. From the coding to the integration of every single choice and branch, Ara-chan worked tirelessly to make sure the game ran smoothly. Thanks a bunch Ara-chan!! _\*gives smol kiss on forehead\*_

And then there was **Steve**, our designer, who took on the monumental task of creating the title screen. It had to capture the spirit of the game: playful, heartfelt, and just the right amount of charming. Steve really knocked it out of the park, giving the game a visual identity that matched its heart.

I can’t forget about the artists who helped bring the four different endings to life. Each of these endings had to feel unique—something that was a direct reflection of the choices players made throughout the game. Considering THIS was the image I sent the artists, I can say with the utmost confidence that they really blew it out of the park with their creations!

For the ending "A Love Unspoken", **Sep** truly captured the quiet longing and emotional distance between the characters. The ‘subtle’ details in their artwork spoke volumes about unspoken words and unsaid feelings. Follow them on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sep_poppo" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

**Nato** brought their own distinctive style to the ending "A Love That Got Away". It was the perfect visual representation of an ending with what-ifs. You can find Nato's work on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_na.to_" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

And lastly, **Siddharth Mittal**’s artwork for "An Unexpected Love" was a breath of fresh air, perfectly encapsulating the surprise and joy that comes from a love that develops when you least expect it. Siddharth’s ability to convey the warmth and spontaneity of this  ending made it feel alive and authentic.
