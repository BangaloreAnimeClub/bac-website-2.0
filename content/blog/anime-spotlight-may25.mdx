If you're looking for a lighthearted slice-of-life comedy with workplace dynamics and budding romance, then _Servant Ã— Service_ is the anime for you. Set in a government office in Hokkaido, the series follows the everyday lives of a few new and established civil servants.

The anime focuses on character interactions, and the humor that arises from their eccentric personalities. It shows the relatable awkwardness of office interactions, the slow burn of developing friendships, and the little quirks that make the characters interesting and likeable. While not exactly a laugh-out-loud type of comedy, the anime has a lot of witty wordplay, office pranks, and recurring gags. Animated by studio A-1 Pictures, there are 13 episodes and it's a complete adaptation of its 4-koma manga.
