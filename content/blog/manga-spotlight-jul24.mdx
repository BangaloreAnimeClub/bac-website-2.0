**_Bless_** by _Yukino Sonoyama_ is a great coming-of-age drama about former model Udagawa Aia, and Sumisaki Jun â€” a tall, freckled girl who was bullied for the way she looks. The story is about these two individuals on opposite ends of the talent spectrum. Aia is a passionate hard worker aiming to be a professional make-up artist, and Jun a naturally gifted model; they encourage and cultivate confidence in each other to overcome their insecurities and chase their ambitions.

I often call this manga the love child of _Runway de Waratte_, _Blue Period_, and _Wandance_; it has that same style of narrative, of two characters being each other's drive. There is also that abundance of information about one particular industry, in this case fashion. The dynamic between Aia and Jun is very organic, and is the most engrossing part about _Bless_. \

**_Mizu wa Umi ni Mukatte Nagareru_** by _Rettou Tajima_ is a mellow, light-hearted yet poignant slice of life drama. This series is quite unassuming, and it's almost guaranteed to feel underwhelming the first time you read this. But the readability of the series, its well-coupled comedic-dramatic moments and an overall spirit of bittersweetness makes this series a great read whose experience is enriched the longer you ruminate over it. The setting is quite similar to _Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou_ by Ruri Miyahara, but while that series is a much more youthful comedy, _Mizu wa Umi ni Mukatte Nagareru_ is a much more mature take following young Naotatsu, who finds himself mixed with a crowd of weirdos and gets tangled up in the insecurities of the fellow resident Chisa.
