Created by Kazuki Hiraoka, *The Urban Legend Files* is a comedy/supernatural manga featuring occult fanatic Mokume-san. She just joined college and chose her university specifically for its Occult club. But the club only hosts pizza-parties as Kugutsu, a senior student rumoured to attract all sorts of urban legends, has left the club now and spends time losing gambles. Catch Mokume-san trying to make her college years worth it as you read through her hilarious occult experiences and dialogue delivery. If you like college settings, comedy and supernatural elements, this is the manga for you.
