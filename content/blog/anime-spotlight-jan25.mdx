_Kakushigoto_ tells the story of Kakushi Goto, a doting single dad and manga artist, and his adorable daughter, Hime. However, Kakushi desperately tries to hide his profession from Hime, convinced she'll be mortified if she finds out that he draws lewd gag manga for a living.

From disguises to ridiculous explanations, the dad is always one step away from being exposed. But beyond the comedy, the bond between Kakushi and Hime is very touching and believable, and the anime beautifully shows the challenges and joys of parenthood.

The animeâ€™s clean art style, color palette, and the simple yet charming character designs stand out. The animation is beautiful, the characters are endearing, and the story is both funny and heartwarming. If you enjoy wholesome slice-of-life anime with a focus on family, humour, and a visually appealing aesthetic, _Kakushigoto_ is definitely worth a watch.

**_Kino's Journey_** is an episodic anime directed by Ryuutarou Nakamura, and produced by Studio A.C.G.T.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup> The anime adapts the light novel series authored by Keiichi Sigsawa.

The story follows Kino, a 15-year-old traveler, and Hermes, a talking motorcycle, as they journey through different countries each with their own unique customs and values. Here, each country serves as a kind of thought experiment, and through such experiments, the show explores a wide range of philosophical ideas in a way that is accessible to everyone. It examines the truths and contradictions of humanity, but without offering clear answers. Instead, it invites viewers to step into Kino's shoes and draw their own conclusions, encouraging a deeper reflection on life itself.

<p id="ref-1">[1] The anime has two versions: the original 2003 series and a 2017 reboot. However, the general consensus across the internet is to start with the 2003 version which is the one I will be focusing on too.</p>
