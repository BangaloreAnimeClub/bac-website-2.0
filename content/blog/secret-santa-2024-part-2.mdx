      Hey **Sneha**,

      I would like to recommend this anime "Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou" (Daily Lives of High School Boys).
      It's a hilarious slice-of-life comedy anime that perfectly captures the awkwardness, humor, and pure silliness of teenage life. From absurd classroom comedy to relatable after-school shenanigans and hilarious misunderstandings, this show will make you laugh and may remind you of your school days and the good times you had with your friends.
      The anime's unique blend of humor and relatable characters makes it a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a good laugh. Whether you're a fan of anime or not, you're sure to find something to love in this show.
      Let me know if you give it a watch!

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hey **Khushi**,  

      I was thinking about your preferences of anime for stories with a magical twist and characters you can really connect with, and I just *knew* you‚Äôd adore *Kamisama Kiss*! It‚Äôs such a beautiful mix of romance, humor, and heartfelt moments, and I think it‚Äôs perfect for someone like you who likes and appreciates slice of life / Romcom which has a story that feels like a warm hug.  

      The main character, Nanami, is someone I feel you‚Äôd really relate to. She‚Äôs resilient, kind-hearted, and manages to stay optimistic even when life throws her a curveball. I believe you  will admire characters who grow stronger through challenges, and Nanami‚Äôs journey from an ordinary girl to a land god is so inspiring.  

      And then there‚Äôs Tomoe‚Äîthe mischievous yet loyal fox spirit who becomes her familiar. His sharp wit and protective nature will have you laughing and swooning in equal measure. I hope you enjoy characters who seem tough on the outside but have a soft spot for the people they care about, and Tomoe is the definition of that.  

      The anime also has plenty of tender, feel-good moments that I know will tug at your heartstrings‚Äîespecially the way it shows the importance of trust, love, and finding your own place in the world. Plus, the supernatural world with its gods, spirits, and other whimsical characters makes it a magical escape that you‚Äôll absolutely get lost in.  

      I thought of *Kamisama Kiss* for you because it has that balance of lighthearted fun and deeper emotions that you might  enjoy in a story. It‚Äôs a cozy, uplifting watch, and I think it‚Äôll feel like a little piece of magic during the holidays.  

      I hope you love it as much as I think you will! Wishing you a wonderful time watching it and the merriest Christmas ever!.

      Merry Christmas, Khushi! üéÖüéÑ‚ù§Ô∏è \

      Hi **Nandan**! Merry Christmas üéÅ üéÑ 

      My gift for you is an anime which appears to be a uplifting SoL comedy at first (which it is but there's more to it) but is rather deeper than you think. It easily handles sensitive topics and might teach you a thing or two about hardships in life and make you appreciate the little things you haveü§ç 

      "Hinamatsuri" is an absolute gem of a comedy anime. It‚Äôs about a yakuza guy, Nitta, whose life gets totally flipped when a random girl with insane psychic powers, Hina, crashes into his apartment‚Äîliterally. What follows is a hilarious mix of chaos, parenting struggles, and wholesome moments.

      The humor is spot-on, with Nitta and Hina‚Äôs interactions being pure gold. But what really makes this show shine is how it sneaks in emotional depth, especially with side characters like Anzu, who will totally tug at your heartstrings.

      The animation looks great, the jokes land perfectly, and the story is just the right mix of silly and sweet. If you‚Äôre looking for something funny with a surprising amount of heart. You'll surely enjoy watching this (which I hope u haven't yet) 

      I chose this anime as it fits most of your preferred genres and even made sure to re-watch it myself just to make sure this is perfect for you( I watched this years ago and mostly forgot the plot but remember it being very enjoyable and deep). Hope you like itüòä

      Hi **Kingjcr**, 
      
      This series is not your quintessential anime that I have seen in your extensive and well selected collection. This is a different aesthetic using conventional Japanese art styles with 2D/3D hybrid art too.
      Now, I am aware that it doesn't fall into what most traditionally consider anime, but please do give it a watch. 

      Your preferred themes all align in this fairly recently developed show with ample action and adventure with a healthy dose of romance too. It delves deep into the Edo period Japan as you can imagine from the name of the anime. In a sense, it's a slice of life showing the way different social classes live and the rampant divide present in the community.
      The protagonist is someone you gradually come to understand and respect in this complicated and gripping thriller.

      I am aware this may not appeal to some, and I hope that you enjoy it and apologise in advance if you don't.
      It's a hauntingly melancholy show with great buildup and an ending that just might make it all worthwhile.
      I hope you consider this recommendation and wish you all the best in your future endeavours.

    Hey **Varun**! 
    
    As your secret santa I would like to recommend you "Insomniacs after school". It's a romcom, slice of life genre anime. It's a really beautiful anime which has a very interesting story line and has very vivid and welcoming animations. I don't wanna spoil the whole plot but it's an anime based on two high school students Ganta nakami and Isaki Magari who suffer from insomnia. Due to this medical condition both of them have trouble sleeping in night and are mostly tired and sleepy during day time. The whole anime shows the adventures and the wholesome bond they both form together. From incredible stolibe to amazing animations to wholesome characters. This anime has it all! I don't want to spoil it any futher. I would really appreciate if you watch this anime and please let me know after watching your thoughts about my recommendation. (Ps: if u have already watched it! Sorry the next best I would recommend is back street girls:gokudolls or I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in The Real World, Too. ) Arigato!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

      I see **Rui**, that you have requested some fun genres to be selected from and for which, I have tried to select a gift which you shall enjoy. Do forgive me if what I have selected is something you have watched already before as I have been doing this for not long (recently recruited by Santa!). This series on hearing the name might have you wonder what we are talking about? Is this demons? St. Nick and demons? Yes, it is. But the fun part is the demons are all working in hell and are wanting to enjoy their lives with a bit of romance and happiness. Yes it has comedy and romance, for one might say it is RomCom. Even the top brass in hell have juniors who they like and some superiors love themselves a bit of fluff. This one, May this special gift brings you to smile from ear to ear. Merry Christmas!

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hey **AraAraSayonara**,

      <u>Apothecary diaries</u> \
      I'm aware this is bit mainstream but i love it so much I wanted to recommend. Story is a about maomao, servant in inner palace (also genius apothecary) and jinshi a very handsome enuch. maomao solves mysteries happening in inner palace, involving emperor and consorts. Content warning is lots of mention of prostitution, pregnancy, seggs, pedophilia and lot of questionable stuff in society. it's amazing and romance between jinshi and maomao (which is currently not much in anime) makes your heart flutter.It's very emotional at certain parts  (honestly anime censored it and toned it down a lot) I highly recommend continue reading it's manga once you finish it. It got lots of mystery and female mc is super clever and very funny, I'm sure you'll enjoy her antics. I really loved how all mysteries are piece of big puzzle, that wasn't spoiler but hint for you to watch closely if you decide to watch it. 

      <u>Princess Tutu</u> \
      This is very treasured hidden gem of mine from my childhood (I'm ancient person). Look wise and name wise it will look very childish but believe me it's lot deeper than it seems. Story is about duck who became a girl to save a prince from stories that came to life. Prince has his heart broken (literally) and pieces scattered all over, tutu collects those pieces that are connected to each emotion and memory of prince. There aren't any trigger warnings but since it's very, VERY old you might have difficult time tolerating it's art style. Romance is very microscopic despite the fact it's prince and princess story, but it does increase over time. Ultimately it's a funny romcom that you'll enjoy.
      (Bonus recommendation if mods let me add this without 700 characters)
      UFO baby(daa daa daa) -
      This used to be anime on animax, it's super cute simple anime. It's about a alien baby that got lost in a wormhole and ended up at FMC and MC's house. MC and FMC look like his mom and dad so they all live like family while various blunders happen. It's super sweet romcom and very funny with it's art style.

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Dear **Hotspot**,

      Since you love sports and action, I've got something uniquely awesome for you: Megalo Box! Imagine boxing, but with a gritty cyberpunk twist and an art style that feels like a love letter to classic 90s anime. Don't worry - no vampires, harems, or crossdressing here - just pure adrenaline and heart.

      The story follows "Junk Dog," an underground boxer who fights his way up from the depths of society to compete in Megalonia, the world's biggest boxing tournament. What makes this show special is its perfect blend of sports action and character drama, all set to one of the best anime soundtracks ever made (seriously, the jazz/hip-hop fusion is incredible!).

      The animation style is deliberately retro, giving it this unique, timeless feel that stands out from modern anime. And at just 13 episodes for season 1, it's the perfect length for a complete, satisfying story (though there's an amazing season 2 if you get hooked!).

      You can watch it on Crunchyroll. I recommend the Japanese audio with subtitles for the full experience, but the English dub is solid too. For a taste of the vibe, check out the opening song "Bite" by LEO Imai!
      Can't wait to hear what you think about this hidden gem!

      Happy watching! \

      Hello **gintoki6**,

      Imagine a pill that would make you 10 years younger and provide you the opportunity to relive your younger days. That's the one liner of the story Relife. I believe you'd like this recommendation as you've a liking towards normal paced, slice of life and a sheer satisfaction of moment while watching your anime (atleast from the anime I've seen you listed at Anilist). It was quite hard for me to find solid recommendation for you considering you've already watched most of the anime that popped up in my mind to recommend for you. Back to the essence of the anime, it's a very short anime. The protagonist navigates his new life as a high school student, he encounters various challenges and experiences that force him to confront his past mistakes and learn valuable lessons about himself and others. Wishin you the happiest holidays with this recommendation. 

      Merry Christmas!!! \

      Hey **Ishandeep Dey**, 
      
      After going through the preferences, I chose an anime that only excludes sports and has elements of the other ones which is Fruits Basket (2019), the reboot version. While it's predominant demographic is shoujo, which you are a little familiar with from Ouran High School Host Club, it does have romance, slice of life, mystery and bits of action and blends a lot of genres and felt like this'd be perfect for you to get into more of genres like shoujo which you haven't explored a lot. It has a unique premise, focuses a lot on character growth, family dynamics, romance, etc and it's pretty emotional, given you have rated Clannad well, you'll find these aspects to be great in this show as well. Also, like some of the other animes on your list that are rated highly, this one does have a relatively large cast of characters, and each of them is given closure. In terms of production, the animation quality is good, the music fits and the opening and ending songs are good and the story follows the manga faithfully with a lot of attention to detail. Coming to the possible downsides, it does have a love triangle, but it isn't the sole focus of the story, and even though it does have a long buildup (both the love triangle and the earlier parts of the story might feel slow moving), it will have a resolution and you will most likely end up being satisfied at the end, some people don't seem to like Tohru as a character but since you have gone through Clannad, it's not gonna be a problem. The entirety of the anime does span over 63 eps with the first season having 25 eps. I tried my best not to spoil any plot points and I think you will and hope that you have a great time with it!

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hey **Utsav**,

      Since I‚Äôve almost fully immersed myself into anime of late, I don‚Äôt often notice this, but if you observe carefully there are certain genres heavily underrepresented in anime when compared to wider fiction, film, and TV (and vice versa as well, such as slice of life). Some of this, of course, is cultural; for instance, the Japanese aren‚Äôt really into cop or spy action thriller flicks, because neither are major cultural institutions for them, unlike the US where the bulk of these come from. Some, however, can‚Äôt be explained away as easily.

      The classical detective mystery is one of these.

      Detective Conan does some really heavy lifting here, because there isn‚Äôt a lot of the traditional Sherlock kind of mystery fiction. There‚Äôs almost always a different sort of twist on it: Bungo Stray Dogs, Apothecary Diaries, Death Note, Psycho-Pass, Death Parade. These are all good works in their own regard, but they don‚Äôt scratch the same sort of itch that Agatha Christie or Gosho Aoyama does. Perhaps it‚Äôs our cultural Britishness, in that we grow up with a lot of fiction of this kind, but it‚Äôs not as though Japan is short of these. There is a whole genre of mystery fiction called honkaku, which is focused on ‚Äúauthenticity‚Äù: namely, the orthodox, classical whodunnit type of detective fiction. However, it is all in the form of novels. It doesn‚Äôt seem to have made the jump to anime.

      In anime, most mystery works have some sort of sci-fi or fantastical twist, like I mentioned earlier. And look, being subversive or quirky is fine and all, but...sometimes, when you‚Äôre craving biryani, you‚Äôre craving good old biryani. At that moment, you don‚Äôt want to be served some experimental fusion dish that uses quinoa instead of rice and duck breast instead of chicken thighs, and worst of all no boiled egg (shocking). You can‚Äôt gorge yourself silly on that, can you?! It might be a nice tasty dish and all, but biryani it is not. My local Sharief Bhai wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead serving that!

      Perhaps this is what made Gosick stand out to me. It was so earnest about its classical detective elements and the Victorian era aesthetic, that I completely forgot about all the supernatural elements. Finally! Some good food. Who cares about the ectoplasmic garnish? It‚Äôs not even a detective story, you say? Who cares! If it looks, sounds, and tastes like one...

      Gosick can be described as a cross between Hyouka, Fullmetal Alchemist, and the Monogatari series. It follows the adventures of Victorique de Blois, a cute doll-like yet sharp-tongued genius detective, and her assistant Kazuya, a transfer student from Imperial Japan. Ah yes, did I mention this was set in a fictional European country? The Victorian aesthetics are on full display here. I like how they use this to justify Victorique‚Äôs frilly gothic lolita fashion (where the title no doubt comes from); it looks convincingly period European enough. They sell this even further by not exoticizing this design in the way most anime would. It‚Äôs not a fetish thing here at all! It‚Äôs just a normal part of the scenery, perfectly conceivable that one might dress like this. This is having your cake and eating it too. Good play, Sakuraba Kazuki-sensei.

      More on the mysteries. They are actually not groundbreaking. The initial few cases are the kind you‚Äôd have seen plenty of before. They are made even less interesting by the fact that Victorique is too intelligent and solves them easily. But they allow for character interactions and development. The side cast is pretty neat and memorable; Victorique‚Äôs brother whose hair can pierce the heavens (you‚Äôll know when you see it) is the highlight. The dialogue between Victorique and Kazuya is smooth and quirky and keeps things flowing; dare I say there‚Äôs a hint of romance? Reminds me of the dialogue in Monogatari or Bunny Girl Senpai. More importantly, these cases set the tone and keep you occupied while a grand mystery unfolds in the backdrop, revealing an overarching plot centred on Victorique‚Äôs background and the shadow war between two government entities.

      This is all quite enthralling, no doubt, but...what happened to the mystery detective fiction part? Isn‚Äôt that why I liked Gosick? Well, I no longer mind as much. To revisit the quinoa duck biryani example earlier, the reason why I don‚Äôt often like experimental takes on classic comfort food has less to do with the ingredients and more to do with the attitude behind the recipe: a sort of pretentious Michelinifying of these dishes, almost like the original dish is being ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by making it more sophisticated. But if someone who truly loved biryani were to make one with quinoa and duck instead of rice and chicken, I think it could turn out fine (removing the boiled egg is still sad though). That which comes from a place of love and sincerity will always shine through.

      Which is why I seat Gosick at the same table as Conan and the others, because ultimately it has the essence, the soul of mystery fiction, because it is made with a love for whodunnit mystery. Even if it makes its detective eschew the cap and cane for a frilly lolita dress, it still has her toy with a pipe while thinking. Even if there is a grand overarching mystery in the end, it still makes you sit through all the smaller cases at the start. Even if the detective is too overpowered for these mysteries by herself, she still has a Watson tag along with her. Every convention of the genre is honoured and taken seriously while still telling an original, subversive story. Good play, Sakuraba Kazuki-sensei. Well played.

      Yes, this is still a Secret Santa recommendation! No it‚Äôs not a standalone review I wrote without you in mind at all; I was merely being subversive, teehee. I recommend it to you. I think it matches up well with your tastes, especially stuff like Conan and Apothecary Diaries; it also matches up well with your genre requirements, being primarily a mystery with strong romance and supernatural elements. It is something of a forgotten show these days. I hope you enjoy it.

      Hey **Karan**, 
      
      This is probably one of my favorites when it comes to emotional and inspiring anime. Although it looks like a typical sports anime, the drama part is 70% of the anime. There is more emphasis on human connections and individual challenges rather than just the sport itself. Each character has a distinct personality, their own back story and character development arc. This diversity creates a dynamic group that feels authentic and relatable and this makes you connect with all the characters. Even minor characters receive depth, making their growth throughout the anime satisfying. The direction and story telling is amazing, with a perfect balance of drama and light hearted moments. The animation is good, (same studio as Haikyuu!). Another thing I really liked was how authentic/real it is. If you're looking for something emotional and inspiring, this is it. Comes with really good openings and endings too!

      Hey **moolekkari**,

      If you're looking for an anime that beautifully blends historical, educational, and award-winning elements, you should definitely watch "In This Corner of the World". The anime movie is set during World War II in Hiroshima and Kure, it explores the life of Suzu Urano, a young woman navigating the hardships of wartime Japan while maintaining her resilience and creativity in art.

      Hey **code_stormer**,

      If you‚Äôre into gore and psychological anime, I have to tell you about Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (Higurashi: When They Cry) released in 2006. This anime is a wild ride that will mess with your head in the best possible way. It starts off looking like a chill, slice-of-life story in a quiet little village, but don‚Äôt let that fool you. Before you know it, it dives straight into paranoia, dark secrets, and moments that will leave your jaw on the floor.

      Here‚Äôs the deal: it‚Äôs got gore, but it‚Äôs not just random blood and guts. The violence is psychological‚Äîit amplifies the tension and makes the stakes feel real. The story is all about trust, betrayal, and the unraveling of relationships in the most shocking ways. If you love trying to figure out the truth while feeling like you‚Äôre constantly one step behind, this is for you.

      It‚Äôs kind of like Mirai Nikki in how it throws you into a game of survival where people you think you can trust may be your worst enemies. And the way it explores the fragility of the human mind and delves into existential themes? Totally gives off Evangelion vibes. Like Evangelion, Higurashi forces you to confront uncomfortable truths and pushes its characters (and you) to the brink.

      And let‚Äôs not forget the non-linear storytelling. If you enjoyed piecing things together in shows like Paranoia Agent or loved the constant ‚Äúwhat is going on!?‚Äù moments in Mirai Nikki, you‚Äôll feel right at home here.

      Just a heads-up‚Äîthis one‚Äôs a psychological roller-coaster. Don‚Äôt watch it alone at night (unless you enjoy creeping yourself out!). I can‚Äôt wait to hear what you think‚Äîespecially after those first WTF moments!

      Since we are limited to just one recommendation I couldn't add any more similar shows. If we meet anytime later we can surely dive into more such mind boggling and heart wrenching animes.

      Catch you later, \

      Hey **Rakesh**! 
      
      If you're looking for an exhilarating blend of action and adventure, I highly recommend checking out Afro Samurai available on Crunchyroll. This anime(1 hour 40 min movie else 5 episodes in total) The series is packed with intense battles against a variety of foes, showcasing stunning animation and a unique visual style that sets it apart from other anime.

      The soundtrack, produced by RZA from Wu-Tang Clan, perfectly complements the action, blending hip-hop with traditional Japanese music, creating an immersive experience. With only five episodes in the original series and a sequel film, it's a quick yet impactful watch that dives deep into themes of revenge, loss, and the consequences of violence.

      What makes Afro Samurai particularly special is its representation of a black protagonist in a genre where such characters are rare, adding a layer of cultural significance. If you enjoy action-packed narratives with a strong emotional core, this anime is definitely a great fit for you!

      Since I don't have any MAL profile link I am not sure you have already watched it or not incase you have watched it, then next recommendation will be Parasyte: The Maxim (TV Series 2014‚Äì2015) :)

      Hi **Yang Wenli**

      The anime i am gonna recommend is 
      The eminence in shadow
      Its a crazy anime filled with action, peak comedy, scifi, mystery and a lot
      I really hope you like this anime. After going through your list i saw a lot of romance, comedy and drama. You did watch many anime i was thinking to suggest too. So i had to remember ones which no 1 easily suggests and i hope this will cater to your taste. I know it was only 1 anime suggestion, but when i was thinking what to suggest, a lot came to my mind and i couldn't select 1 that easily. But thought this is peak and i have to give the best. It has 2 seasons. On both seasons, you will never feel bored. 

      Happy binging..... \
      Merry Christmas \

      Hi **Tejus**, 
      
      I will recommend you to watch "March comes in like a lion" from slice of life genre. This anime is highly rated but not very popular. I think it is one of the best and very unique in its genre. You can feel the emotional state of characters like coldness of loneliness and warmth of affection, which makes it an exciting watch with rollercoaster of emotions. It showcases how characters deal with their everyday struggles which makes them relatable. The main character plays shogi(Japanese chess) as a professional but the show is not focused on his journey to the top. Story focuses on his growth as a person and the role people around him plays in his journey. We get to know backstory of the other characters as well. Also visuals are so beautiful that you can just take screenshot of many scenes and use it as wallpaper.

      Hiii **Enigma**, 

      Well I really hope you are doing well , and now coming to the main topic as you haven't provided me with your myanime list , then it would be a bit hard to recommend you something but let's try , I'll try to suggest which is quite underrated hoping you must have seen the popular ones.

      So the first anime which I would like to recommend is "Claymore" , well to be honest I really love badass women like erza from fairy tail and because of which I across this anime to look for some similar such girls lol , so if I have to brief you about this anime then the plot is set in a medieval world infested by monstrous creatures called Yoma that feed on humans. To combat them, a mysterious organization creates hybrid warriors‚Äîhalf-human, half-Yoma‚Äîknown as Claymores, named after the massive swords they wield. The story follows Clare, a low-ranked Claymore, on her journey of revenge against a powerful Yoma responsible for her tragic past.

      So yeah it's a fun watch in my opinion. 

      Apart from that one of my fav anime with badass characters is " black lagoon " I don't know whether you have seen this or not ,if you have seen this then it's really amazing but if you haven't then highly recommend it's one of the few anime with ground story and accurate with full of violence and fun fights , it's still one of my favourite out so far. It got two seasons but once you get started with it then you can't come back before you finish ,so I won't be sharing synopsis because it's a must watch for action genre lovers.

      While if I have to suggest something in mystery or something related to horror element which I really missing from anime Industry , I want to see more horror anime but there is one which I would like  you to check out is " Another " it's a short anime with 12 or 13 eps but is really crazy it will keep you hooked up till the end ,with edging you to the seat and that suspense will haunt you .

      And as I can see you are not a big fan of Isekai,well than if I have to suggest few Isekai which is not generic and cheesey they "Rezero" is something which you will love to check out. 

      But out of all if you like some crazy shit related to Brain and scify , basically something nerdy related to puzzled and all then what can be better than " phi brain " ,well being a science and engineering student I really relate to the main character and last not least i would love to suggest one more anime which is "future diary" this anime is just psych and will keep you hooked up and if you are watching this then ending might feel incomplete then remember to check ova/ special episode which was canon. 

      But I also like to suggest one more thing but it's not an anime its a live action series " Alice in botherland " it's a Japanese drama available on Netflix , it got two seasons and it's complete ,but it's really goated one of the best I have seen so far so please definitely check this .

      Ig I'll be signing off now , even though I wanna go on but I shouldn't make this too lengthy or the admins will gonna kill me haha , but I just wanna miss you merry christmas and a happy new year. Who knows in future we may meet then would love to discuss about the recommendation which I gave and would love to know whether you have seen these or not

      And before going i would love to suggest two songs for this winter

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hi **Raphael** 

      The fact that it is Christmas and if I don't rec Hayate no Gotoku it will be a incomplete. 
      1. It is a Highschool cum Romcom anime. Ik you didn't want a highschool rec but trust me this is peak 
      2. It is not limited to Highschool though only some Ovas or Episodes are Highschool related and then it follows towards a normal show 
      3. It is pretty old and every episode is a fresh start so even if you Hold it for a bit it will seem fresh once you start again
      4. The plot seems simple and it might seem like a tear jerker at first but it turns into a whole new level when the story kicks in and all the different characters showup. 

      Kamisama kiss was in your waitlist so I recommend that too. It is the perfect anime for you. Start it ASAP if you hated my other rec. Ciao.

      Hey **Sharad**!

      First of all, happy winter holidays! This is a great time to catch up on the anime that you've wanted to watch this year but couldn't :)

      While going through your MAL, it was apparant that we have very similar watch preferences when it comes to slice-of-life and rom-com anime. You've watched a number of KyoAni shows too. Since you listed slice-of-life as your first preferred genre but haven't watched Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid yet, I can't help but recommend you just that!

      Dragon Maid is certainly one of the best (if not the best?) looking slice-of-life anime I've ever watched. Even from Kyoto Animation standards, they really went all out for this project, and it shows in every frame of the anime how much love and care has been put into animating it and bringing the manga to life.

      The story begins when a stray dragon from another world, Tohru, meets Kobayashi, a hardworking office lady, in a drunken encounter. One thing leads to another and they both become best friends and start living together in a Tokyo apartment! Their friendship is the core of the series, and their daily interactions are sure to make you smile the whole time. Soon, a bunch of other adorable dragons join in with the main cast, and the show follows their clumsy daily lives in the human world. 
      
      The anime is filled with funny and heartwarming moments, the visuals are stunning, the vibrant watercolor-like color palette, and every movement and expression is just beautifully animated. But above all, it's the character moments in Dragon Maid that really stand out, it reminds us of the things that are truly important in life ‚Äî spending time and making fun memories with your family and friends, the people that you care about. I can't think of a better anime to end this year :D

      Wishing you a merry christmas, and a very happy new year! \

      Hello **Mio**, \
      Wishing you Merry Christmas Ho ho ho ho !!!

      Based on your said genres and your ep count, exclusions I narrowed it down to Xam'd: Lost Memories. It was a total wild card for me too when I discovered it. I believe it's an original anime from studio bones with an ep count of 24-25. I was absolutely blown away by how good the first ep was and it immediately pulled me in. The show covers most of the genres you mentioned but I can promise it'll surprise you like anything with its premise, power system, world building, characters, and the gorgeous art style and animation. They absolutely knocked it out out of the park in those departments. It was the prime Bones at their work. The opening is one of my all time favs by the band Boom Boom Satellite, not sure if you've heard of them but they produce great music. Can't get into much detail as a lot of things unravel as you move ahead in the show. If nothing else I feel it'll be a good addition to your watchlist, one you'll never forget. 

      Apologies in advance if you've already watched it. I didn't have access to your watchlist so don't know but I can guarantee it's absolutely not a mainstream show.

      I look forward to knowing you virtually or irl and hearing your feedback on the show.

      From your secret Santa \
      With love, care and a lot of kokoro‚ù§Ô∏è \
      Happy Holidays :)

      Hey **DrunkOnBytes**,

      I've chosen Little Busters after a lot of thinking and looking at ur MAL list. Little Busters is comedy, slice of life drama with tear jerking moments): A bunch of friends enjoying their school life to the fullest. The problems they face individually and how MC n other friends hello Raj other out of their issues. (Skip little Busters Ex if u hate drag, as it is completely unrelated to the main storyline) just watch Little Busters n little Busters refrain). I've seen ur MAL I'm glad to know ppl watched n also read KHR it's such a refreshing anime. Not to mention u also watched gems like Nura, Inuyashiki, Akashic records, Noragami, NGNL, Btooom, etc...... Hope u like what I've recommended. Happy watching!
