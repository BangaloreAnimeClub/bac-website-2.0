  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#6</span> Romeo × Juliet** 
</div>

The _Romeo × Juliet_ anime is exceptional because it reimagines Shakespeare’s classic as a high-fantasy epic, blending political intrigue, rebellion, and magical elements like flying horses. Juliet shines as a sword-wielding heroine, while the story expands the original tragedy with emotional depth, moral complexity, and nods to other Shakespeare works. Stunning animation, a sweeping orchestral score, and a perfect balance of romance and action make it a timeless, unforgettable adapation.

</div>

The supporting cast consists of walking Shakespeare references. Alongside characters from the original play, such as Conrad and Tybalt, there are nods to other works: Francisco (a guard from Hamlet who witnesses the king's ghost), Curio (a character from Twelfth Night), and even Shakespeare himself. Referred to himself as Willy.

"For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#7</span> True Tears**
</div>

_True Tears_ is such an underrated gem - beautifully crafted with stunning visuals, a touching story, and characters that feel real.

The story follows Shinichirou, an aspiring artist caught in a delicate web of relationships, childhood bonds, unspoken feelings, and painful misunderstandings. What I love most is how raw and human the emotions are. Noichi and Hiromi’s struggles hit hard, and the way their stories intertwine is just… chef’s kiss!

</div>  

And can we talk about the art? Studio PA Works nailed every frame is like a painting, especially those soft watercolor backgrounds. The soundtrack? Perfectly subtle, enhancing every emotional moment without overpowering it.  

The ending … no spoilers, but it’s so satisfying. It doesn’t take the easy way out, and that’s what makes _True Tears_ special. It’s not just another romance it’s about growth, healing, and the messy, beautiful reality of love.  

If you love slow-burn dramas with deep character development, _True Tears_ is a must-watch.

  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#8</span> Paranoia Agent**
</div>

_By the legendary Satoshi kon, Madhouse_

_Paranoia Agent_ is the only TV anime directed by Satoshi Kon. He is known for making amazing movies like _Perfect Blue_ and _Paprika_, which are intense suspense films. The more time you spend watching them, the more you question what’s happening, and the more invested you become. The art style is unique, and that’s what enhances the suspense, as the visuals often include foreshadowing.

<div style={{marginBottom: '0px', marginTop: '0px', textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/blog/anime-which-people-dont-talk-about/08.webp" className="rounded-xl" style={{margin: '0 auto', display: 'block'}} />
</div>

_Paranoia Agent_ is a psychological thriller about a mysterious attacker, "Lil' Slugger," who targets people in Tokyo. As detectives investigate, the story offers unique storytelling, explores the human psyche, tackles thought-provoking themes, features a twisted plot, and includes memorable characters. As a masterpiece by Satoshi Kon, it's perfect for anyone who enjoys mind-bending narratives.

<div style={{marginBottom: '-10px', marginTop: '0px'}}>
  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#9</span> Air**
</div>

_Tatsuya Ishihara, Jun Maeda, Kyoto Animation_

_Air_ is a heartfelt anime about a traveling performer, Yukito, who meets a lonely girl named Misuzu in a small town. He becomes involved in her life while searching for the "Girl in the Sky," a figure from his family's legends. The story explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the enduring bonds between people, blending emotional drama with supernatural elements. It's a touching and bittersweet tale that will likely leave a lasting impression.

Key is famous for creating lovable characters that you grow attached to, only to later rip your heart out in feels. If you know anything about Key, you've probably heard of _Clannad_, _Kanon_, and _Air_. One thing is certain when watching a Key anime: it will either make you cry and hit you right in the feels, or it won't.

</div>

Like any other Key or KyoAni show, _Air_ can be incredibly sad at times, yet it also balances comedy and drama effectively. It serves as a prominent precursor to _Clannad_ and _Clannad: After Story_ in terms of emotional depth and storytelling. If you enjoyed those, you should give _Air_ a try. _Air_ stands out due to its unique setting and the way it handles its characters, which is why I love it so much.

<div style={{marginBottom: '-10px', marginTop: '0px'}}>
  # **<span style={{'color': 'red'}}>#10</span> Magic Knight Rayearth**
</div>

When people talk about the most popular magical girl shows, they always mention _Sailor Moon_ and _Cardcaptor Sakura_. However, there's one particular magical girl anime that stands out from the rest: _Magic Knight Rayearth_. It's a 1994 anime about three girls — Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu—who get pulled into a magical world called Cephiro. They get isekai'd, becoming Magic Knights who use magic and mechas to save a princess and the world. The story focuses on friendship, bravery, and finding inner strength, with a surprising twist. It's a classic mix of fantasy and adventure, loved for its compelling characters and emotional depth.

<div style={{marginBottom: '0px', marginTop: '0px', textAlign: 'center'}}>
  <img src="/images/blog/anime-which-people-dont-talk-about/10.webp" className="rounded-xl" style={{margin: '0 auto', display: 'block'}} />
</div>

Magic Knight Rayearth was overshadowed by CLAMP's other well-known magical girl series, _Cardcaptor Sakura_. Additionally, Rayearth's mascot, Mokona, was later featured in _Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle_ and is now more commonly associated with that series than with Rayearth.

The series is often underrated because it's "again" more overshadowed by CLAMP's more popular works like _xxxHolic_, _Chobits_, or _X_ (which, the manga is still on hiatus since forever, damnit) . Its blend of genres and older animation style might also make it less accessible to newer anime fans, but it remains a hidden gem for those who discover it. 

But it wouldn't matter for CLAMP fans because they never miss out on any of CLAMP's works.
